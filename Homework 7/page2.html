        <h1> The Missing Keys </h1>
        <p>It's the dreadful year of 2020. Its the end of June, and my lease is up
        <p>I wake up at 7:00am. Ive saved every bit of packing and cleaning for the day I must be out</p>
        <p>My friend meets me at 8:00am to help move out. He has a truck and I need it to move my stuff</p>
        <p>We clean and we clean, we get all of my things outside the house, things are looking good</p>
        <p> Then... I go to find my keys to open my car and start packing. But I cant seem to find them</p>
        <p> I look some more, still cant find them</p>
        <p> I start unpacking my clothes, everything Ive just put away, tearing apart bags, searching in every pants pocket</p>
        <p> Hours pass, I drive to my parents looking for a spare, no spare. I realize it's locked in my car</p>
        <p>We try to break into my car but cant get the door open. It's getting late and im feeling desprate</p>
        <p> Around 7:30pm my roomate gets home, my things are scattered around the living room, torn apart from looking for my keys</p>
        <p>"Carter is there any chance you have seen my keys?" "You mean those Keys?"</p>
        <p>Carter points to the key hanger in the living room, right next to the front door, there hang my keys</p>
        <p> I never put my keys there...</p>
